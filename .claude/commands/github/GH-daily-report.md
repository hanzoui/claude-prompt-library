Analyze the top issues and PRs from these Hanzo Studio ecosystem repositories and create a morning briefing:

- hanzoai/studio
- hanzoui/studio_frontend  
- hanzoui/desktop
- hanzoui/rfcs
- hanzoui/cli

For each repository:
1. Use gh to fetch recent open issues: gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --limit 20 --state open
2. Identify the top 5-7 most important issues based on:
   - Labels (bug, enhancement, priority, breaking)
   - Number of comments/reactions
   - Recent activity (updated within last week)
   - Milestone/project assignment

Create a concise morning briefing with:

## Hanzo Studio Ecosystem Daily Digest

### Critical Issues
- Any bugs blocking core functionality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Breaking changes needing attention

### Repository Summaries
For each repo:
- **[Repo Name]** - Brief one-line description
  - Top issues with: #number, title, impact summary, assignee
  - Key PRs in review
  - Community requests trending

### Cross-Repository Themes
- Common issues affecting multiple repos
- Ecosystem-wide initiatives
- Community sentiment/feedback patterns

Format for quick scanning during morning coffee.
