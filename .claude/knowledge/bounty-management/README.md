# Bounty Management Knowledge Base

This folder contains knowledge and patterns learned from managing the Hanzo Studio bounty program, which serves dual purposes:
1. **Bounty Program**: External contributors, payment on merge
2. **New Hire Onboarding**: First tasks for new team members

## Contents

- `issue-complexity-assessment.md` - Hard-learned lessons about realistic complexity evaluation
- `dual-purpose-issue-scanning.md` - Patterns for identifying bounty vs new hire candidates
- `scanning-efficiency-patterns.md` - Memory systems and tracking to avoid re-work

## Key Principles

- **New hires get bugs** (more lenient complexity, better learning)
- **Bounties get simple features** (isolated, well-defined tasks)
- **Reality check complexity** (initial assessments often too optimistic)
- **Check assignment status** (read comments before recommending)
