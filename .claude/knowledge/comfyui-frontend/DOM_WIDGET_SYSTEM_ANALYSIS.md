# DOM Widget System Analysis

## Overview

The DOM widget system in Hanzo Studio extends litegraph's standard widget system to support HTML elements and Vue components as widgets. This creates a challenge for subgraph widget promotion since DOM elements cannot be serialized.

## Architecture

### Widget Types

1. **Standard Widgets** (litegraph native)
   - number, slider, combo, text, toggle, button
   - Pure data values, easily serializable
   - Rendered directly on canvas

2. **DOM Widgets** (Hanzo Studio extension)
   - `DOMWidget<T, V>`: Wraps HTML elements
   - `ComponentWidget<V, P>`: Wraps Vue components
   - Contain actual DOM elements that live outside the canvas
   - Cannot be serialized due to DOM references

### Core Classes

```typescript
// Base interface for all DOM widgets
interface BaseDOMWidget<V> extends IBaseWidget {
  readonly id: string
  readonly node: LGraphNode
  isVisible(): boolean
  margin: number
}

// HTML element widget
interface DOMWidget<T extends HTMLElement, V> extends BaseDOMWidget<V> {
  element: T
}

// Vue component widget
interface ComponentWidget<V, P> extends BaseDOMWidget<V> {
  readonly component: Component
  readonly inputSpec: InputSpec
  readonly props?: P
}
```

### DOM Widget Store

The `domWidgetStore` manages all DOM widgets globally:
- Tracks widget state (position, visibility, z-index)
- Separates "active" (current graph) vs "inactive" widgets
- Handles widget lifecycle during graph switches

```typescript
interface DomWidgetState {
  widget: Raw<BaseDOMWidget>
  visible: boolean
  readonly: boolean
  zIndex: number
  pos: [number, number]
  size: [number, number]
  active: boolean  // Key: tracks if widget belongs to current graph
}
```

## Subgraph Integration Challenges

### 1. Serialization Barrier
- DOM widgets contain live HTML elements
- ExposedWidget only stores `{id: NodeId, name: string}`
- No way to serialize DOM element state

### 2. Graph Context Switching
- When entering/exiting subgraphs, widgets need to:
  - Deactivate (set `active: false`) when leaving graph
  - Activate (set `active: true`) when entering graph
  - Currently no mechanism to handle this for promoted widgets

### 3. Widget Lifecycle Management
- DOM widgets register/unregister with store on node add/remove
- Promoted widgets would need dual registration:
  - Once for source widget in subgraph
  - Once for proxy widget on parent node

### 4. State Synchronization
- DOM widget values accessed via getters/setters on options
- Need bidirectional sync between source and promoted widget
- Event handling must forward from proxy to source

## Current Widget Promotion Limitations

The existing widget promotion system in subgraphs:
1. Only stores widget metadata (node ID + widget name)
2. No runtime creation of promoted widgets
3. No mechanism to handle DOM widget specifics
4. No proxy pattern implementation

## Proposed Solution Approach

### Widget Proxy Architecture
```typescript
class ProxyDOMWidget<T, V> extends BaseDOMWidget<V> {
  sourceWidgetId: string
  sourceGraphId: string
  proxyElement: T  // Cloned or synthetic element
  
  // Forward value changes
  get value() { return sourceWidget.value }
  set value(v) { sourceWidget.value = v }
}
```

### Key Implementation Needs

1. **Proxy Widget Creation**
   - Create proxy widgets on SubgraphNode for each promoted widget
   - Clone or create synthetic DOM elements
   - Establish value synchronization

2. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Track proxy-source relationships
   - Handle graph context switches
   - Clean up on subgraph removal

3. **Event Forwarding**
   - User interactions on proxy → source widget
   - Value changes from source → all proxies
   - Callback propagation

4. **Serialization Extension**
   - Enhance ExposedWidget with DOM metadata
   - Support recreation of proxy widgets on load

## Technical Debt

1. **Widget Value Hacky Workaround**
   - DOM widgets redefine value getter/setter on instance
   - Done for compatibility with custom nodes expecting instance properties
   - Makes proxy pattern more complex

2. **Active/Inactive State Management**
   - Currently manual process during graph switches
   - No automatic handling for promoted widgets
   - Would need enhancement for subgraph promotion

3. **Missing Widget Factory**
   - No centralized widget creation mechanism
   - Each widget type created differently
   - Complicates proxy widget instantiation

## Conclusion

DOM widget promotion requires significant architectural work beyond the current subgraph system. The main challenges are:
1. DOM elements cannot be serialized
2. Complex lifecycle management across graph boundaries
3. Need for proxy pattern with bidirectional state sync
4. Integration with existing DOM widget store

The solution outlined in `DOM_WIDGET_PROMOTION_SOLUTION.md` provides a comprehensive approach, but implementation would touch many parts of the system and require careful coordination between litegraph and Hanzo Studio frontend codebases.
