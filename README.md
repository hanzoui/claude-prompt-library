## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Commands are automatically available in your Claude Code session when working in this project
3. To make commands globally available, copy desired command files to `~/.claude/commands/`
4. **Install Gemini CLI** (required for large context analysis tasks):
   - Install from [google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
   - Used automatically for tasks exceeding Claude's context window
5. **Set up filepath mapping** (required for repository analysis commands):
   ```bash
   cd project-summaries-for-agents
   cp filepath-mapping.json.template filepath-mapping.json
   # Edit filepath-mapping.json with your local repository paths
   ```
   See [project-summaries-for-agents/README.md](project-summaries-for-agents/README.md) for details.
6. **Install claude-code-vector-memory** (required for memory integration and search):
   - The semantic memory system is required for searching through past conversations
   - Install from: [claude-code-vector-memory repository](https://github.com/christian-byrne/claude-code-vector-memory)
   - After cloning the repository, navigate to the semantic-memory-system directory and run the setup script:
     ```bash
     cd claude-code-vector-memory/semantic-memory-system
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - The setup script will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, build the initial index, and run a health check
7. **Install Context7 MCP** (optional but recommended):
   - Provides official documentation for many libraries via the `/research-with-auto-mcp` command
   - Install the Context7 MCP server or CLI from its repository and ensure it is running locally when using research commands

## Creating New Commands
